                                    Makara/Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan or Maghi or simply Sankranti, also known in West
                                    Bengal as Mokor Sonkranti, in Mithila as Til Sakraait and in Nepal as Maghe
                                    Sankranti, 'Sankranti' here means ‘transfer’, this day is considered as the
                                    transition day of Sun into Capricorn. Now the sun moves northwards in the Hindu
                                    calendar, dedicated to the deity Surya (sun), many native multi-day festivals are
                                    organised all over India. It is observed each year the day Sun enters the Capricorn
                                    zodiac which corresponds with the month of January as per the Gregorian
                                    calendar. It marks the first day of the sun's transit into Makara rashi
                                    (Capricorn).

                                    Due to the addition of one day in leap years, the date of Makar Sankranti may vary a
                                    bit. On leap years it falls on 15 January, otherwise on 14 January.

                                    The festivities associated with Makar Sankranti are known by various names Magh Bihu
                                    in Assam, Maghi in Punjab, Maghi Saaji in Himachal Pradesh, Maghi Sangrand or
                                    Uttarain (Uttarayana) in Jammu, Sakrat in Haryana, Sakraat in Rajasthan, Sukarat in
                                    central India, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Uttarayan in Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh,

                                    called Khichidi Sankranti), Uttarakhand (also called Uttarayani) or as simply,

                                    (Kashmir).[citation needed] On Makar Sankranti, the Sun god is worshipped along with
                                    Lord Vishnu and goddess Lakshmi throughout India.

                                    Makar Sankranti is observed with social festivities such as colourful decorations,
                                    rural children going house to house, singing and asking for treats in some areas,[8]
                                    melas (fairs), dances, kite flying, bonfires and feasts. The Magha Mela,
                                    according to Indologist Diana L. Eck, is mentioned in the Hindu epic
                                    Mahabharata. Many observers go to sacred rivers or lakes and bathe in a ceremony
                                    of thanks to the sun. Every twelve years, the Hindus observe Makar Sankranti
                                    with Kumbha Mela – one of the world's largest mass pilgrimage, with an estimated 60
                                    to 100 million people attending the event. At this event, they say a
                                    prayer to the sun and bathe at the Prayagaraj confluence of the River Ganga and
                                    River Yamuna, a tradition attributed to Adi Shankaracharya.</p>
