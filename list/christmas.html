                                    Kolkata Christmas Festival, held annually during the month of December in Kolkata on
                                    Park Street, Kolkata, is one of the largest dedicated Christmas carnivals in India.
                                    The themed lighting starts from St Xavier’s College and ends at Jawaharlal Nehru
                                    Road. This has been extended in recent years at both ends - up to the Mullick Bazar
                                    crossing on Park Street and up to St Paul’s Cathedral on Cathedral Road, an offshoot
                                    of Jawaharlal Nehru Road. Another offshoot of celebrations and lighting has been
                                    extended till Vardaan Market on Camac Street. This themed lighting is designed by
                                    artisans from the nearby town of Chandannagar.

                                    Bands and various choir groups perform on the stage at Allen Park on Park Street. A
                                    two-hour Christmas Parade is also organised on one of the days in which about 500
                                    school children participate.
