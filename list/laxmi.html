                                    Lakshmi Puja (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मी पूजा, romanized: Lakṣmī Pūjā), is a Hindu occasion
                                    for the veneration of Lakshmi,
                                    the goddess of prosperity and the supreme goddess of Vaishnavism. The occasion falls
                                    on the amavasya (new moon
                                    day) in the Vikram Samvat Hindu calendar month of Kartik, on the third day of
                                    Deepavali. It is considered to be
                                    the main festive day of Deepavali. In Assam, Bengal, and Odisha, this puja is
                                    celebrated 5 days after Vijaya
                                    Dashami.

                                    According to popular belief, Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and
                                    Vishnu's wife, visits her
                                    devotees, and bestows good fortune and her blessings upon them. To welcome the
                                    goddess, devotees clean their
                                    houses, decorate them with finery and lights, and prepare sweet treats and
                                    delicacies as offerings. Devotees
                                    believe that the happier Lakshmi is during her visit, the more she blesses the
                                    family with health and wealth.

                                    In Assam, Odisha, and parts of Bengal, Lokkhi Pujo or Lakshmi Puja (লক্ষ্মী পূজা) is
                                    performed on Ashvin Purnima
                                    day on the month of Ashvin, the full moon day following Vijaya Dashami and Durga
                                    Puja. This puja is also known
                                    as Kojagori Lokkhi Pujo. Women worship the goddess Lakshmi in the evening, after
                                    cleaning their house and
                                    decorating the floor of their houses with alpona, or rangoli. It is celebrated in
                                    the evening with all family
                                    members participating in decorating and cleaning home as part of the puja.
