    <P>Lakshmi Puja (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मी पूजा, romanized: Lakṣmī Pūjā), is a Hindu occasion for the veneration of Lakshmi,
        the goddess of prosperity and the supreme goddess of Vaishnavism. The occasion falls on the amavasya (new moon
        day) in the Vikram Samvat Hindu calendar month of Kartik, on the third day of Deepavali. It is considered to be
        the main festive day of Deepavali. In Assam, Bengal, and Odisha, this puja is celebrated 5 days after Vijaya
        Dashami.

        According to popular belief, Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and Vishnu's wife, visits her
        devotees, and bestows good fortune and her blessings upon them. To welcome the goddess, devotees clean their
        houses, decorate them with finery and lights, and prepare sweet treats and delicacies as offerings. Devotees
        believe that the happier Lakshmi is during her visit, the more she blesses the family with health and wealth.

        In Assam, Odisha, and parts of Bengal, Lokkhi Pujo or Lakshmi Puja (লক্ষ্মী পূজা) is performed on Ashvin Purnima
        day on the month of Ashvin, the full moon day following Vijaya Dashami and Durga Puja. This puja is also known
        as Kojagori Lokkhi Pujo. Women worship the goddess Lakshmi in the evening, after cleaning their house and
        decorating the floor of their houses with alpona, or rangoli. It is celebrated in the evening with all family
        members participating in decorating and cleaning home as part of the puja.
