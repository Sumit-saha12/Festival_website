                               <p> Located in eastern India along the Hoogly river, Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) is often referred to as the
            cultural capital of India. With the grand colonial architecture, rich traditions, beautiful music and art, this
            city has a unique character. As a home to esteemed artists like Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray, among
            others, the people of this city have a special appreciation for literature as well as cinema.The city also
            provides an unparalleled religious and cultural experience of Durga puja each year.
    
            “Dugga Dugga “echo the united voices of all the ladies in the household as they move towards the pandals for
            pujo, wishing for a safe journey ahead in life. The sound of intense beats coming from the dhak mixed with the
            aroma of the dhunuchi lit in every house, park or corner fills the streets of Kolkata. Clad in the most
            beautiful attires, adorning the heaviest of jewels and thickest of bangles with sindoor and bindis on their
            temple, the women seem to walk a step ahead of the men today. After all, Durga pujo is the day of the Devi.
            Nothing but colour and festivity flow through the lanes in the nine days that Maa Durga stays in her basha
            (house) with her four children, only to be united with her husband Shiva on the tenth day, (also known as
            Vijayadashami). But does it really end there? The massive grandeur and style of Durga puja is not restricted to
            being just a nine-day festival. It houses itself in the hearts of the devotees who utter “Maa Dugga” at the
            smallest of hiccups in life. The resounding ullu (a high-pitched ululation sound created by striking both cheeks
            with the tongue believed to be very auspicious and said to ward off any evil) echoes in the streets of the city
            long after the pujo is all wrapped up.</p></font>
