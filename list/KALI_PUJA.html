                                While the rest of India celebrates Diwali and Laxmi Puja, the state of West Bengal does things differently.
                                You’ll uncover different rituals, customs, and foods. And unlike the rest of the country, worship (puja) in West
                                Bengal involves the fierce goddess, Kali. Kali symbolizes divine energy or shakti. She destroys evil within the
                                world and outside it — the universe owes its redemption to her. Kali (also called Kalika) is the first among 10
                                indomitable goddesses or the Dasa Mahavidyas of Hindu mythology.
                        
                                Her name also means time, death, and darkness. If one looks at statues depicting her likeness, it’s easy to see
                                why. Kali wears a garland containing the heads of decapitated demons with one foot on Lord Shiva’s chest. It’s
                                an awe-inspiring, terrifying sight and a story with great mythological significance.
                        
                                Legends say that two demons (Nishambhu and Shambu) once roamed the heavens, creating chaos and destruction in
                                the realm of Indra (the King of Gods.) The demons became powerful, forcing the Gods to take refuge in the
                                Himalayas, where they sought guidance from Goddess Durga. To restore balance, Kali was born out of Durga’s
                                forehead.
                        
                                Kali embarked on a quest to destroy the demons. She killed them and made a garland of their heads to wear around
                                her neck. But power and rage overwhelmed Kali. She went on a rampage, slaughtering everyone in her path. Lord
                                Shiva decided to intervene, but a rage-fuelled Kali stepped on Shiva unknowingly. She finally realized what she
                                had done. When you look at popular depictions of the goddess Kali, artists and sculptors immortalize this moment
                                in mythology.
                        
                                The legend has been around since the dawn of time. The festival, not so much. Kali Puja celebrations gained
                                popularity in West Bengal as recently as the 19th century. King Krishnachandra of Navadvipa spearheaded the
                                movement, along with wealthy landowners in Bengal. Although ordinary folk went along with it initially to avoid
                                the king’s wrath, the practice slowly became a tradition. Today, Kali Puja and Durga Puja are synonymous with
                                life and culture in Bengal. People pay tribute at various Kali temples and shrines. Some embark on long
                                pilgrimages for her. Celebrations each year are grand and only get bigger.
