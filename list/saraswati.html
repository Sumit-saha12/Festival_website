                                    preparation for the arrival of spring. The festival is celebrated by people of
                                    Dharmic religions in the South
                                    Asian countries in different ways depending on the region. Vasant Panchami also
                                    marks the start of preparation
                                    for Holika and Holi, which take place forty days later.The Vasant Utsava (festival)
                                    on Panchami is
                                    celebrated forty days before spring, because any season's transition period is 40
                                    days, and after that, the
                                    season comes into full bloom.</p>

                                    preparation for Holika and Holi, which occur forty days later. For many, Vasant
                                    Panchami is the festival
                                    dedicated to goddess Saraswati who is their goddess of knowledge, language, music,
                                    and all arts. She
                                    symbolizes creative energy and power in all its forms, including longing and love.

                                    Saraswati's favorite color. People dress in yellow saris or shirts or accessories,
                                    share yellow-colored snacks
                                    and sweets. Some add saffron to their rice and then eat yellow cooked rice as a part
                                    of an elaborate feast.
                                    Many families mark this day by sitting with babies and young children, encouraging
                                    their children to write their
                                    first words with their fingers, and some study or create music together.The day
                                    before Vasant
                                    Panchami, Saraswati's temples are filled with food so that she can join the
                                    celebrants in the traditional
                                    feasting the following morning. In temples and educational institutions, statues of
                                    Saraswati are dressed in
                                    yellow and worshiped. Many educational institutions arrange special prayers or pujas
                                    in the morning to seek
                                    the blessing of the goddess. Poetic and musical gatherings are held in some
                                    communities in reverence for
                                    Saraswati.

                                    visit Saraswati temples and also worship Goddess Saraswati at home (Saraswati Puja).

                                    the major festivals for Bengali Hindus and observed by many households; most schools
                                    arrange Saraswati puja for
                                    their students on their premises. In Bangladesh too, all major educational
                                    institutes and universities observe
